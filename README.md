Description: Pneumonia is a life-threatening lung infection found globally. This project explores the use of deep learning  in automated pneumonia detection through chest X-ray images. DL algorithms have greatly advanced medical diagnosis, and this study summarizes a recent DL-based system for pneumonia detection. It covers essential datasets, ensemble learning, and deep transfer learning methods, along with performance metrics. Research from databases like Scopus, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore is reviewed. Finally, challenges in applying DL for pneumonia detection and future research directions are discussed.
